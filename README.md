## Question 1

Given this class that represents a giant:

```swift
class Giant {
 var name: String = "Fred"
 var weight: Double = 340.0
 let homePlanet: String = "Earth"
}

let fred = Giant()
```

Will these three lines of code run? If not, why not?

```swift
fred.name = "Brick"
fred.weight = 999.2
fred.homePlanet = "Mars"
```

Fix the class definition for `Giant` in the space below so that it **does** work:



this code will not work because the variable "homePlanet" is declared as a constant which cant be mutated.  In order to give homePlanet a new value it needs to be decalred with the key word "var" instead of let
class Giant {
var name: String = "Fred"
var weight: Double = 340.0
var homePlanet: String = "Earth"
}

let fred = Giant()

fred.name = "Brick"
fred.weight = 999.2
fred.homePlanet = "Mars"





## Question 2

Take a look at this struct that represents an alien:

```swift
struct Alien {
 var name: String
 var height: Double
 var homePlanet: String
}
let bilbo = Alien(name: "Bilbo", height: 1.67, homePlanet: "Venus")
```

Will these three lines of code run? If so, why not?

```swift
bilbo.name = "Jake"
bilbo.height = 1.42
bilbo.homePlanet = "Saturn"
```

Change the declaration of `bilbo` so that the above three lines of code **do** work:



this code will not work because the variable "bilbo" is declared as a constant which cant be mutated.  In order to give bilbo new values it needs to be decalred with the key word "var" instead of let

struct Alien {
var name: String
var height: Double
var homePlanet: String
}
var bilbo = Alien(name: "Bilbo", height: 1.67, homePlanet: "Venus")

bilbo.name = "Jake"
bilbo.height = 1.42
bilbo.homePlanet = "Saturn"






## Question 3

Consider this bit of code that uses the `Giant` class:

```swift
let edgar = Giant()
edgar.name = "edgar"
let jason = edgar
jason.name = "Jason"
```

What will the value of `edgar.name` be after those three lines of code are run? What will the value of `jason.name` be? Why?



//edgar.name will be = edgar
//jason.name will be = Jason
//edgar gets initally set to Giant making edgar.name = "fred"; this is then changed by edgar.name = "edgar"
//jason gets initally set to edgar making jason.name = "edgar"; this is then changed by jason.name = "Jason"

class Giant {
var name: String = "Fred"
var weight: Double = 340.0
var homePlanet: String = "Earth"
}

let edgar = Giant()
edgar.name = "edgar"
let jason = edgar
jason.name = "Jason"







## Question 4

Given this bit of code that uses the `Alien` struct:

```swift
var charles = Alien(name: "Charles", height: 2.25, homePlanet: "Pluto")
var charlesFromJupiter = charles
charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Jupiter"
```

What will the value of `charles.homePlanet` be after the above code run? What about the value of `charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet`? Why?



//charles.homePlanet will be = "Pluto"
//charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet will be = "Jupiter"
//charles gets initally set to Alien making charles.homePlanet = "Pluto"
//charlesFromJupiter gets initally set to charles making charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Pluto"; this is then changed with charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Jupiter" making charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet will be = "Jupiter"


struct Alien {
var name: String
var height: Double
var homePlanet: String
}
var charles = Alien(name: "Charles", height: 2.25, homePlanet: "Pluto")
var charlesFromJupiter = charles
charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Jupiter"





## Question 5

Here's a struct that represents a bank account:

```swift
struct BankAccount {
 var owner: String
 var balance: Double

 func deposit(_ amount: Double) {
 balance += amount
 }

 func withdraw(_ amount: Double) {
 balance -= amount
 }
}
```

Does this code work? Why or why not?

Fix the `BankAccount` struct so it does work.

Given the code below (which should incorporate any fixes you made):

```swift
var joeAccount = BankAccount(owner: "Joe", balance: 100.0)
var joeOtherAccount = joeAccount
joeAccount.withdraw(50.0)
```

What will the value of `joeAccount.balance` be after the above code runs? What about the value of `joeOtherAccount.balance`? Why?



//since the functions below are nested in the struct "BankAccount" in order to change the value of balance through thta function the function must be declared with the keyword "mutating"
struct BankAccount {
var owner: String
var balance: Double

mutating func deposit(_ amount: Double) {
balance += amount
}

mutating func withdraw(_ amount: Double) {
balance -= amount
}
}


//the value of joeOtherAccount.balance will be $100 because when it is created it is set to joeAccount which was itself initialieed using the argument balance: and the parameter 100.00.
//the value of joeAccount.balance will be 50.00 since in the last line of code joeAccount.withdraw(50.0) reduces the balance from 100.00 to 50.00
var joeAccount = BankAccount(owner: "Joe", balance: 100.0)
var joeOtherAccount = joeAccount
joeAccount.withdraw(50.0)
print(joeOtherAccount.balance)






## Question 6

a. Write a struct called `Person` that has 3 properties of type `String`: a first name, a last name and a middle name. Have the middle name be optional. Create 2 instances of a `Person`, one with a middle name and one without. Print one of their first names.


b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.





struct Person {
var firstName: String
var middleName: String?
var lastName = String()

func FullName() -> String {
let nilCoalMiddle = middleName ?? ""
return "\(firstName) \(nilCoalMiddle) \(lastName)"
}
}


var person1 = Person(firstName: "Ian", middleName: "Thomas", lastName: "Cervone")
var person2 = Person(firstName: "Natalia", middleName: nil, lastName: "Padilla")

print(person1.FullName())





## Question 7

a. Create a struct called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`, of type `String`, `String`, and `Double` respectively. Create some instances of `Book`.


b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7




struct Book {
var title = String()
var author = String()
var rating = Double()
func isGood(rating: Double) -> Bool {
if rating > 7.0 {
return true
} else {
return false
}
}
}

var ianStory = Book(title: "Ian's Bedtime Stories", author: "Ian Cervone", rating: 10.0)

print(ianStory.isGood(rating: ianStory.rating))






## Question 8

```swift
class Dog {

}
```

Work through the following tasks one by one, in order. Each time, add to the `Dog` class above. Each task has sample output that you should be able to replicate when you are done.

a. Give `Dog` four properties, all with default values: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

```swift
var dog1 = Dog()
dog1.name //returns "dog"
dog1.breed //returns "unknown"
dog1.mood //returns "calm"
dog1.hungry //returns false
```

b. Add an instance method called `playFetch()`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and print "Ruff!"

```swift
var dog2 = Dog()
dog2.name = "Rhett"
dog2.breed = "English Setter"
dog2.mood = "excited"
dog2.hungry = false

dog2.playFetch() //prints "Ruff!"
dog2.hungry //returns true
dog2.mood //returns "playful"
```

c. Add an instance method called `feed()`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should print "The dog doesn't look hungry"

```swift
var dog3 = Dog()
dog3.name = "Partner"
dog3.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog3.mood = "thoughtful"
dog3.hungry = true

dog3.feed() //prints "Woof!"
dog3.hungry //returns false
```

d. Add an instance method called `toString` that returns a `String` type description of the dog:

```swift
var dog4 = Dog()
dog4.name = "Rascal"
dog4.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog4.mood = "feeling pawesome"
dog4.hungry = true
print(dog4.toString())
//prints:
//Name: Rascal
//Breed: Golden Retriever
//Mood: feeling pawesome
```

e. Add a type property called `count` that keeps track of how many dogs have been created so far.

//Ex: There have been four dogs created so far
`Dog.count //returns 4`





class Dog {
var name = String("dog")
var breed = String("unknown")
var mood = String("calm")
var hungry = Bool(false)

func playFetch() {
hungry = true
mood = "playful"
print("Ruff!")
}

func feed() {
if hungry == true {
hungry = false
print("Woof")
} else {
if hungry == false {
print("the dog does not look hungry")
}
}
}
func toString () -> String {
return "Name: \(name) \nBreed: \(breed) \nMood: \(mood)"
}
}


var dog1 = Dog()
print(dog1.name)
print(dog1.breed)
print(dog1.mood)
print(dog1.hungry)

var dog2 = Dog()
dog2.name = "Rheet"
dog2.breed = "English Setter"
dog2.mood = "excited"
dog2.hungry = false

dog2.playFetch()
print(dog2.mood)
print(dog2.hungry)

var dog3 = Dog()
dog3.name = "Partner"
dog3.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog3.mood = "thoughtful"
dog3.hungry = true

dog3.feed()
print(dog3.hungry)

var dog4 = Dog()
dog4.name = "Rascal"
dog4.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog4.mood = "feeling pawesome"
dog4.hungry = true
print(dog4.toString())








## Question 9

There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

C = (F - 32) / 1.8
F = 1.8 * C + 32
K = C + 273

a. Make a struct called `FreezingPoint` that has three static properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.


b. Make a struct called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`. Make the values of `fahrenheit` and `kelvin` correct values, converted from the `celsius` property.

```swift
var tenDegreesCelsius = Celsius(celsius: 10.0)
tenDegreesCelsius.celsius //returns 10.0
tenDegreesCelsius.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
tenDegreesCelsius.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
```

c. Give the `Celsius` struct a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).




struct FreezingPoint {
let fahrenheit: Double = 32.0
let celsius: Double =  0.0
let kelvin: Double = 273.0
}

struct Celsius {
var celsius =  Double()
func getFahrenheitTemp(celisus: Double) {
let fahrenheit = 1.8 * celsius + 32
let kelvin = celsius + 273.0
print("temp is celsius = \(celsius)")
print("temp in fahrenheit = \(fahrenheit)")
print("temp in kelvin = \(kelvin)")
}
}


var tenDegreesCelsius = Celsius(celsius: 10.0)
tenDegreesCelsius.getFahrenheitTemp(celisus: 10.0)






## Question 10

Create a struct called `RGBColor` that has 3 properties, `red`, `green`, `blue` that are all of type `Double`.

Given the below array of color dictionaries, create an array of `RGBColor`.

```swift
let colorDictArray: [[String: Double]] = [["red": 1.0, "green": 0.0, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.0, "green": 1.0, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.0, "green": 0.0, "blue": 1.0],
 ["red": 0.6, "green": 0.9, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.2, "green": 0.2, "blue": 0.5],
 ["red": 0.5, "green": 0.1, "blue": 0.9],]
```


## Question 11

a. Create a struct called `Movie` that has properties for `name` (`String`), `year` (`Int`), `genre` (`String`), `cast` (`[String]`), and `description` (`String`). Create an instance of your `Movie` class

b. Create an instance method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."


## Question 12

Create a function outside of your `Movie` struct called `makeMovie` that takes in a dictionary of type `[String: Any]`, like `dieHardDict` below, and returns an `optional Movie`. Use `dieHardDict` to create an instance of a `Movie`.

```swift
let dieHardDict: [String: Any] = ["name": "Die Hard",
 "year" : 1987,
 "genre": "action",
 "cast": ["Bruce Willis", "Alan Rickman"],
 "description": "John Mclain saves the day!"]
```

Hint: To use a value type `Any`, you will need to cast it to its expected type.

Below, `nameAsAny` is of type `Any` because thats the type of the value in the dictionary:

```swift
if let nameAsAny = dieHardDict["name"] {
 print(nameAsAny)
}
```

Below, `nameAsString` is of type `String` because the optional binding is attempting to cast it as a `String`.

```swift
if let nameAsString = dieHardDict["name"] as? String {
 print(nameAsString)
}
```

If the binding fails it returns `nil`. `1987` cannot be cast as a `String` because it is a number.

```swift
if let yearAsString = dieHardDict["year"] as? String {
 print(yearAsString)
} else {
 print("this didn't work")
}
```

## Question 13

Given the below array of movie dictionaries, use your function from the last question to create a `Array` of `Movie`.

```swift
// movies is an Array of Dictionaries
// each element of movies is a Dictionary with the keys
// 'name','year', 'genre', 'cast' and 'description'
var movies: [[String:Any]] = [
